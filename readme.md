# My Portfolio Website

### Welcome to the code base

This page contains all the code that powers my portfolio website, which is built solely with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

I did not use any dependencies, frameworks or compilers because I wanted to show my solid grasp of the foundations of web programming. 

**Note:** If you download this project, you should replace the fonts, videos and certain images with your own files as I did not commit all assets to this repository.

### Licensing notice

You may use any of the code in this project for inspiration, or to take useful code snippets as your own or to modify the code to create your own portfolio website without attributing to me **as long as the end result is not identical to my portfolio website.**

> If you wish to post all my code on another website without making substantial changes to the overall project, however, you can do so but you must include the MIT license in that case. Snippets of code are fine to post without attribution.

If you are coding your own portfolio website, I advise you to not simply pass off all my code as your own since the whole point of making a portfolio website is to make it unique to you, and only you know how best to market yourself. You may use this repository as your starting point. 

Good luck, friend!
