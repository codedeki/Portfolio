        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught full-stack developer who has a strong understanding of computer science despite not coming
          from the STEM field. <span>I have one year professional experience with a combined five years of coding
            experience.</span> I think having a degree in computer science does not make one a developer any more than
          reading books and listening to lectures about fixing cars makes one a mechanic. Although books are useful and
          I read practical theory to improve my understanding, I think the best developer is the one who builds
          applications, not the one who studies or who has a PhD. In my experience, 60% of the developer's job is
          knowing how to do research when you don't have the solution to a problem - a skill that my BA in History and
          English Literature taught me well. The other 40% involves planning, organizing, problem-solving and, lastly,
          the coding. Following my undergraduate studies, I spent five years working as a writing tutor for the Writing
          Support Center at the University of Western Ontario, where I taught research and writing skills to a great
          many students. If you're wondering about my soft skills, you should know that by majority student opinion I
          was voted as "the most approachable writing tutor" from among a dozen of my colleagues. I attribute my ability
          to build web apps by myself to my advanced research and problem-solving skills which help me learn as I go and
          navigate third-party APIs. I also have a dog who I'm crazy about and play chess in my spare time.

      <p class="group-desc">These are live apps I built by myself from 2021 to 2023. I'm a big believer in quality over
        quantity in every aspect of life. Volume doesn't concern me as much as I'd rather spend my time building one
        good app than 10 mediocre apps. My goal for my next job is to work with an awesome team of developers as I have not
        yet experienced developing with a team. I think I'd become a senior developer and team lead in no time. I use
        git and github daily so try me. &#128074;</p>

      <p class="group-desc">This is a small sample of the non-production, practice apps I built from 2018 to 2021 while following online tutorials when I was first learning how to code. Although not as impressive as my production apps, my practice apps showcase my dedication to learning and self-improvement. I must have spent 1000 hours on my experience projects. I completed over 50 online courses averaging 10 to 20 hours each. My practice apps are precious to me because they planted a solid foundation in computer programming. &#128640</p>
